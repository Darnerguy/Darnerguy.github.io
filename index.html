                <summary>In computer networking, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer">link layer</a> is the lowest layer in the Internet protocol suite, 
                the networking architecture of the Internet.</summary> The link layer is the group of methods and communications
                 protocols confined to the link that a host is physically connected to. The link is the physical and
                  logical network component used to interconnect hosts or nodes in the network and a link protocol is
                   a suite of methods and standards that operate only between adjacent network nodes of a network segment.
                Despite the different semantics of layering in TCP/IP and OSI, the link layer is sometimes described as a 
                combination of the data link layer (layer 2) and the physical layer (layer 1) in the OSI model. However, the
                 layers of TCP/IP are descriptions of operating scopes (application, host-to-host, network, link) and not
                  detailed prescriptions of operating procedures, data semantics, or networking technologies.

                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer">internet layer</a> is a group of internetworking methods, protocols, and specifications in the Internet protocol
                 suite that are used to transport network packets from the originating host across network boundaries; if necessary,
                  to the destination host specified by an IP address. The internet layer derives its name from its function facilitating
                   internetworking, which is the concept of connecting multiple networks with each other through gateways.
                The internet layer does not include the protocols that fulfill the purpose of maintaining link states between the local
                 nodes and that usually use protocols that are based on the framing of packets specific to the link types. Such protocols
                  belong to the link layer. Internet-layer protocols use IP-based packets.

                In computer networking, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer">transport layer</a> is a conceptual division of methods in the layered architecture of protocols
                 in the network stack in the Internet protocol suite and the OSI model. The protocols of this layer provide host-to-host
                  communication services for applications. It provides services such as connection-oriented communication,
                   reliability, flow control, and multiplexing.

                An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer">application layer</a> is an abstraction layer that specifies the shared communications protocols and interface methods
                 used by hosts in a communications network. The application layer abstraction is used in both of the standard models
                  of computer networking: the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) and the OSI model. Although both models use the same
                   term for their respective highest level layer, the detailed definitions and purposes are different.
